## The end of Week 1 & 2! 🎮 

Happy Friday! 

It's the end of the first couple weeks of makers and I've learend so little yet so much!

First, we've been taught how to use the basics of Ruby. 

Ruby is a programming language that we will be learning over the course of the 12 weeks. 

Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced readability and programming

(Ruby from Steven Universe)

A quote he said about ruby sticks with me, and is perfect analogy 

```Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body```

Right now i've been given the basics of learning how to do the following
* Variables
* Conditional Logic
* Loops
* Classes & Methods
* Arrays and Hashmaps

All sounds really technical and complicated when I write in down in a list like that. However, at the same time it shows how much I have learend in the last two weeks!

I want to go over some of the goals I set out for myself, and a quick emotion check in. 

I've been able to sucessfully debug errors, by using rspec it has shown me errors within my work and I was able to use fellow peers
and google (mainly stack overflow 😅) to resolve these.

Another goal I have hit is only comparing what I individually know from one week to the next instead of focusing on others.
I have been able to go from printing "Hello World!" to setting up classes and methods for a student directory command line text based app!

My main focus emotionally is to focus on the moment, what I can do now and not comparing to what I should be doing in 6 weeks time. I sometimes get curious and look at
future course content and get completly lost, which is what my reaction should be because I haven't worked my way up to it - but my stupid ape brain just gets anxious about it.

I've been attending meditation classed makers set out, and they are superb for recharging my energy and getting ready for the afternoon ahead. 

In all, these past couple of weeks have been lots of fun - despite the amount of change and learning I've had to endure! 

Here's to becoming a sucessfull and proficient DevOps Engineer
