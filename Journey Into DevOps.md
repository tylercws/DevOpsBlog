## Press A to Start Your Journey 🎮

My Journey into DevOps finally begins!👨🏼‍💻 

I've been given the oppurtunity to study a L4 DevOps Apprenticeship with DWP where for 16 weeks I'll be studying at Makers.

"What's Makers?", I hear you ask. Makers is the bootcamp course I have been enrolled into to start learning software development for 12 weeks, then DevOps basics for 6 weeks!
It's going to be alot of head scratching, coffee drinking and overall exciting times to learn all I need to for when I start my new Job!

I use to work as a L1/L2 Help Desk Engineer for an e-commerce company, and when COVID hit I was rushed into the deep end of 1st line Support. Having to support over 6000+ people as 
a 18/19 year old apprentice was a daunting task, but I was always up for a challenege. Once things calmed down and I was left doing the same basics of, "Have you tried turning it on off again?", "I'll remote on and install the printer driver" -  I was left wondering, "Where 
do I go from here?"

I asked around, peered over the shoulders of engineers while fixing their machines and found that DevOps seems to combine the dev and operations side of me.
I was back to when I started as an apprentice, googling and asking questions about DevOps, reading about job offers and the day to day aspects of an Engineer.


Long story short, I applied to become an DevOps Apprentice for DWP and after a couple video interviews and a half day session.. I was accepted!! To say imposter syndrome kicked in was an understatement.

Depsite the looming sense of being an ""fake and not deserving"", I was telling everyone and everything about my new job - even my cats, who seemed to be the least thrilled. 


I'm excited to be an apprentice again, and I'm now back to knowing nothing, asking everything and breaking things for fun!

I'll probably be posting every week, with the progress I have and by the end of 16 weeks I should be able to see a massive difference!
